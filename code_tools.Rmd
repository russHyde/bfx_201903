Pylint prefixes each of the problem areas with a R, C, W, E, or F, meaning:

[R]efactor for a “good practice” metric violation
[C]onvention for coding standard violation
[W]arning for stylistic problems, or minor programming issues
[E]rror for important programming issues (i.e. most probably bug)
[F]atal for errors which prevented further processing
